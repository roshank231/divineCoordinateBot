# divineCoordinateBot
A simple program that will fetch the closest divine coordinate using f3+c and paste it into your clipboard.

To use just f3+c and then activate via a hotkey (can be rebinded)

by default you can hold ctrl + alt and tap p to activate portal divine, the bot will use your f3+c coords to calculate the nearest viable portal divine spot. The bot will return 2 coordinates, the closest coordinate from the full list of possible coordinates, and another from a smaller list of *statistically* better coordinates. 

The information the bot uses is from the portalDivine blind sheet shared by Î»rias#3427.
Additionly the Fossil divine spreadsheets created by Mathew Bolan.

Once you activate the hotkey a screen will apear for user input on direcction, then the coordinates will be pasted to your clipboard within seconds.

The program also supports Fossil divine. (by default) use the ctrl,alt + f with your coordinates pasted from f3+c and then select the targeted block. 

The program will again return 2 coordinates, the closest safe coordinates and the closest Highroll divine coordinates.

**This is an extremely simple fetch and retrieve program that uses easly avalable tables for pure convenience and RTA time-save. it does NOT do any advanced calculations to find the best possible coordinate, simply the nearest nether cordinate to your current position**

Also don't feel the need to go to the **exact** coordinated, its not that important.
